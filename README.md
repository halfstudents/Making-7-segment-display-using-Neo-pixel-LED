Hello guys, I made want to make a 7-segment display. But this time with bigger digits and RGB effects. Because this can be used to display some readings like Clock with Nodemcu, temperature monitoring using Arduino. Also, with an option of color changing after each second or next reading. I also have the similar one, which I designed a while back. That design has some Led orientation problems.
Because last time I used 2 led’s to display per segment, our eye can’t detect it too fast and accurate. Means we need a focus; I am happy with the design but now it’s time for update. JLCPCB is always with me to provide good PCB prototype and SMT assembly service solutions. https://jlcpcb.com/SSR

PCB and Gerbers:
Here is the designed panel, I displayed my name with JLCPCB as a sponsor and good friend.
White color PCB, 1.6mm thickness and HASL finish is looking pretty damn good with JLCPCB SMT Assembly service. These Boards are fully assembled by JLCPCB, means all the components and soldering work is done by them. Why not to try this offer, JLCPCB SMT assembly service is staring from $8 and if you sign-up using this link, you will get free coupons of worth $30 and newcomer rewards. https://jlcpcb.com/SSR

Is JLCPCB SMT assembly worth:
JLCPCB is the only PCB manufacturer providing SMT service in very cheap, yet the quality of boards is very good. I tested my all the Boards and they are working fine, all the components are okay. The soldering work is outstanding and cost is very less.
I ordered 15pcs of these assembled boards just in $48, the cost of components is $27 + cost of PCB ($6 for 15pcs) + Cost of assembly+ stencil+ soldering ($15). Which turns out to $3 per Piece, but if you order the boards in quantity say 30pcs the cost will not be 2x, that will be arranged and the total cost of panel would be near $2.30.
